<h2><b>The Problem</b></h2>

<p>We are given different clusters of points in the $XY$ plane, where each point is defined by its coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Additionally, each point is associated with a class $C_i$, for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant 9$. Our goal is to identify metrics that provide insights into the correlations between each cluster in relation to the others.</p>
